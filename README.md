##  Folium
For this project we explored Folium, a Python library that that combines data wrangling potential in Python and the mapping strengths of the Leaflet.js library. We used Folium to explore data vizualizations using Jupyter Notebooks. Folium was developed in order to enable easy data visualization with geospatial analysis. It helps make interactive geographic visualizations that can be shared as a website. Folium helps transform data in pandas into interactive Leaflet maps.

This is a description and tutorial of the package Folium created as a group project for EDS 217.

### California Earthquakes 1769 - 2015 with magnitudes greater than 5 

https://maps-cnra-cadoc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cadoc::cgs-map-sheet-48-historic-earthquakes-1769-to-2015-california-magnitude-5-0-plus/explore?location=37.380031%2C-119.985577%2C7.27

This dataset was used to make a heatmap, and we narrowed the focus point to only be in California, as the data panned out to neighboring states. Each earthquake has their own unique 'Object ID', along with the coordinates in which the epicenter was found, and the magnitude.
